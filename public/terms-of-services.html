            <h1>Streak Terms of Service</h1>

            <p>Streak Holdings, Inc. ("Streak" or "we") makes available the Streak platform through which fans and other users can interact with athletes to expand, enhance, and deepen their relationships (the "Platform"). The Platform also permits users to (a) purchase or otherwise obtain unique, blockchain-based non-fungible tokens created by or on behalf of Streak or third parties (each, an "NFT") and (b) access, via the NFT, one or more works of authorship associated with such NFT ("Digital Content") (each NFT and associated Digital Content, collectively, the "Digital Collectible"). These Terms of Service ("Terms") apply to your access to and use of the Platform, acquisition of Digital Collectibles, and all services made available on the Platform (collectively, our "Services"). By using our Services, you agree to these Terms, including the mandatory arbitration provision and class action waiver in Section 16. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use our Services.</p>
            <p>We may make changes to these Terms from time to time. If we make changes, we will provide you with notice of such changes by any reasonable means, including by posting the updated Terms on the Platform or sending an email to you at the most recent email address that we have on file for you. The "Last Updated" legend above indicates when these Terms were last changed. Unless we say otherwise in our notice, the updated Terms will be effective immediately, and your continued use of our Services after we provide such notice will confirm your acceptance of the changes. If you do not agree to the updated Terms, you must stop using our Services. Any changes to these Terms will not apply to any dispute between you and us arising prior to the date on which we posted the updated Terms incorporating such changes, or otherwise notified you of such changes.</p>
            <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <u><a href="mailto:support@streak.us">support@streak.us</a></u></p>

The Digital Content may include copyrighted materials, trade names, trademarks or service marks, and names, likenesses, or images of third-party licensors or individuals or entities associated with those licensors. It is important to understand, and you hereby acknowledge and agree, that the NFT is separate from the Digital Content. If you are acquiring a Digital Collectible, you (a) acknowledge that although the NFT itself is sold or otherwise transferred to you, the Digital Content associated with the NFT is licensed to you, and not sold or otherwise transferred to you and (b) agree to the following terms with respect to such Digital Content:</span>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Limited License: Subject to your compliance with these Terms, Streak hereby grants to you, to the extent of its respective rights in the Digital Content, and solely for so long as you are the legal owner of the NFT, a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to access, perform and/or display the Digital Content using the NFT, solely for your personal, non-commercial purposes. Except for the license granted above, Streak and its licensors retain all right, title and interest in and to the Digital Content.</li>
                                <li>Restrictions: You may not, or attempt to, or permit or enable any third party to: (a) separate the Digital Content from the NFT; (b) modify the Digital Content; (c) trademark, copyright or otherwise acquire additional intellectual property rights in or to the Digital Content; (d) use the Digital Content in connection with images, videos or other content, including content that is hateful, intolerant, violent, cruel or that could reasonably be found to constitute hate speech or infringe upon the rights of others; (e) use the Digital Content in connection with any business, message, product, or service, or in any manner that may imply endorsement of any business, message, product, or service; or (f) use the Digital Content in any manner that is likely to cause confusion or dilute, blur, or tarnish the Digital Content or any intellectual property rights in the Digital Content.                                </li>
                                <li>Ownership of Digital Content: The Digital Content, together with all intellectual property rights in the Digital Content, is owned by Streak or its licensors. All use of the Digital Content, including any goodwill generated by such use, will inure to the benefit of Streak or its licensors.</li>
                                <li>Royalties: You acknowledge and agree that Streak or its licensors, or its or their designee(s), may receive royalties from your purchase of an NFT.                                </li>

                    <span> Your User Account and Account Security</span>
                    <p>You need to register for an account to access our Services. When you register for an account, you must provide accurate account information and promptly update this information if it changes. You also must maintain the security of your account and promptly notify us if you discover or suspect that someone has accessed your account without your permission. You must not permit others to use your account credentials. You are responsible for the activities of any users that occur in connection with your account. We reserve the right to reclaim usernames, including on behalf of businesses or individuals that hold legal claim, including trademark rights, in those usernames. Your account is subject to the following conditions:                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Access: You understand and agree that access to your account is limited solely to you. You agree that you will not sell, rent, lease, or grant access to your account to any person without our prior written permission.                        </li>
                        <li>Security: You understand and agree that you are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your account and control over any usernames, passwords, or any other codes that you use to access our Services. Any unauthorized access to your account by third parties could result in the loss or theft of Digital Collectibles held in your account and any associated accounts, including your credit or debit card(s). You understand and agree that you will not hold us responsible for managing and maintaining the security of your account. You further understand and agree that we are not responsible (and you will not hold us responsible) for any unauthorized access to or use of your account.

To ensure that you receive all of our communications, you agree to keep your email address and telephone number current and notify us if there are any changes. You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications delivered to your email address on record is considered valid.                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <li>
                    <span> Suspension of Account</span>
                    <p>You agree that we have the right to immediately suspend your account, pause or cancel your access to our Services, or close your account if we suspect, in our sole discretion, that (a) your account is being used for money laundering or any illegal activity, (b) you have concealed or provided false identification information or other details, (c) you have engaged in fraudulent activity, or (d) you have engaged in transactions in violation of these Terms.                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <span>Hosted Wallets</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hosted Wallets: We will retain the private keys for any NFTs stored in your wallet that are hosted on our Services (your "Hosted Wallet"), for which private keys are necessary in order to transfer any NFTs out of your Hosted Wallet. Streak will use the private keys in order to effect the transfers initiated using your account.</li>
                        <li>Approved External Accounts: You may wish to transfer NFTs to and from an account, wallet, or address not hosted or controlled by Streak ("External Account"). We may require that you verify your control over an External Account or satisfy other verification or screening requirements prior to enabling transfers between the applicable External Account and your Hosted Wallet (any of these External Accounts, an "Approved External Account").</li>
                        <li>Transfers to Your Hosted Wallet: You may periodically at your discretion transfer from an Approved External Account to your Hosted Wallet any NFTs that are supported for transfer and storage using our Services. If you transfer to your Hosted Wallet any NFTs that are not supported by our Services, or if you transfer NFTs specifying an address that does not support the NFTs, those NFTs may be permanently lost.</li>
                        <li>Transfers from Your Hosted Wallet: Subject to any limits on the amounts that you are able to withdraw on a daily or other periodic basis, you may periodically at your discretion withdraw NFTs by transferring NFTs from your Hosted Wallet to an External Account controlled by you. We may require you to verify that any External Account to which you seek to transfer NFTs is an Approved External Account. You hereby authorize Streak to use your Hosted Wallet to send to any External Accountspecified by you the number of NFTs specified by you using our Services.</li>
                        <li>Other Terms Applicable to Transfers: You will be responsible for: (a) paying all fees charged by any third party associated with any External Account or Approved External Account and for paying any fees charged by Streak for any transfers; (b) ensuring that any transfers are handled in compliance with Streak requirements, third-party requirements, NFT requirements, and applicable laws, rules, and regulations; (c) ensuring that the address to which any NFTs are to be transferred is properly formatted and suitable for the type of NFT being transferred; and (d) ensuring that there are no errors in any of the transfer instructions you provide using our Services. In the event you fail to comply with any requirements of this section, the transferred NFTs may be permanently lost. Because any blockchain used to confirm transfer of any NFT is a decentralized network of independent third parties, Streak has no control over them, and therefore cannot and does not ensure that any transfer will be confirmed on any blockchain. The transfer requests you submit via our Services may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the blockchain for the applicable NFT. When you complete a transfer request via our Services, you authorize Streak to submit your transfer request to the applicable blockchain in accordance with the instructions you provide via our Services. The timing for completing any transfer will depend on the blockchain and other third-party actions that are outside the control of Streak or any of its affiliated entities, and Streak makes no guarantee regarding whether a transfer will be completed or the amount of time it may take to complete any transfer.</li>
                       <li> Custodianship: You own all NFTs held in your Hosted Wallet or transferred to your account. Streak does not own any NFTs that it holds for its customers. Although Streak controls the private keys for the blockchain addresses for deposited NFTs, you retain control of your NFTs while in the custody of Streak, subject to these Terms and applicable law. Your NFTs are tracked and maintained on internal ledgers maintained by Streak. Streak has no obligation to segregate any of your NFTs at a separate blockchain address. Your NFTs may be commingled at one or more blockchain addresses with NFTs owned by other users or Streak. For security and operational reasons, transfers of NFTs by you may be reflected on our internal ledgers only, without any transfer on the corresponding blockchain. Private keys may be stored by us offline or in electronic or physical vaults or other secure locations that may only be accessed in accordance with established security procedures, so any transfer of NFTs that will involve a transfer on the blockchain may be delayed.</li>
                        <li>Conditions and Restrictions on Transfer: Streak may at any time and in its sole discretion refuse any transfer request or other transaction request submitted via our Services, impose limits on the amounts of transfers that can be completed on a daily or other periodic basis, or impose any other conditions or restrictions upon your use of our Services, without prior notice. For example, Streak may: (a) limit the number of NFTs that can be purchased or sold on a daily or other periodic basis; (b) restrict transaction requests from certain locations; or (c) restrict withdrawals or other transactions if there is a reasonable suspicion of fraud, diminished capacity, inappropriate activity, or if Streak receives reasonable notice that your ownership of some or all of the NFTs in your account is in dispute.</li>
                       <li> Unclaimed Property: If we hold NFTs in your account or Hosted Wallet and have no record of your use of our Services for several years, we may be required, upon passage of applicable time periods, to report these NFTs as unclaimed property in accordance with the abandoned property and escheat laws. If this occurs, we will use reasonable efforts to give you written notice. If you fail to respond within seven business days or as required by law, we may be required to deliver any such NFTs to the applicable state or jurisdiction as unclaimed property. We reserve the right to deduct a dormancy fee or administrative fee from such unclaimed funds, as permitted by applicable law.</li>
                        <li>Property Disputes: If we receive notice that any NFTs held in your Hosted Wallet are alleged to have been stolen or otherwise not lawfully possessed by you, we may, but have no obligation to, place an administrative hold on the affected NFTs or your Hosted Wallet. If we place an administrative hold on some or all of your NFTs, we may continue the hold until the time when the dispute has been resolved and evidence of the resolution acceptable to Streak has been provided to Streak in a form acceptable to Streak. Streak will not involve itself in any such dispute or the resolution of the dispute. We will have no liability or responsibility for any such hold, or for your inability to transfer NFTs during the period of any hold.</li>

Except for small claims disputes in which you or Streak seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county of your billing address or disputes in which you or Streak seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, you and Streak waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services resolved in court. Instead, for any dispute or claim that you have against Streak or relating in any way to our Services, you agree to first contact Streak and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim ("Notice") to Streak by email at legal@streak.us or by certified mail addressed to Streak, Inc, 4008 El Cerrito Rd, Palo Alto, CA 94306. The Notice must (a) include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be similar in form to that described above. If you and Streak cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after such Notice is received, then either party may submit the dispute to binding arbitration administered by JAMS or, under the limited circumstances set forth above, in court. All disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in San Francisco, California or may be conducted telephonically or via video conference for disputes alleging damages less than $1000, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures ("JAMS Rules"). The most recent version of the JAMS Rules is available on the JAMS website and are hereby incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason.</p>
                    <p>You and Streak agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 17 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the "FAA"), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.</p>
                    <p>The arbitrator, Streak, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including, but not limited to, all information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.</p>
                    <p>You and Streak agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee and Streak will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by Streak, Streak will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and Streak agree that the federal courts of the State of San Francisco and the United States sitting in the Northern District of California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award. Any claim arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, the claim is permanently barred, which means that you and Streak will not have the right to assert the claim. You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section 17 by emailing us at legal@streak.us. In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve disputes in accordance with Section 19. If any portion of this Section 17 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (b) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section 17 or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Section 17; and (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this Section 17 is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section 17 will be enforceable.</p>
